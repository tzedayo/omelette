  <b>3. Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. <br> <br> 
   <b>4. Add fillings(optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. <br> <br>
   <b>5.  Fold and Serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute then slide it onto a plate. <br> <br> 
   <b>6. Enjoy:</b>  Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. </ul> <br>  <hr>
